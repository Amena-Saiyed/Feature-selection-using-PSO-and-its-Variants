# Diabetes Prediction Using Optimized Feature Selection

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting **diabetes mellitus** using advanced feature selection techniques. We utilize **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, **Improved PSO (IPSO)**, and **PSO with Local Search (PSO-LS)** to optimize feature selection, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model and reduce computational complexity.

### Key Features:
- **PSO, IPSO, and PSO-LS** for efficient and optimized feature selection
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers for prediction
- Performance evaluation against standard models, showing accuracy improvements
- Use of the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** for training and testing

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how optimization algorithms (PSO variants) can be applied to improve the performance of machine learning models in predicting diabetes, particularly by reducing the number of features without compromising accuracy.

### Dataset:
The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, a widely used dataset in medical machine learning tasks that includes features like **pregnancies**, **glucose levels**, **blood pressure**, and more to predict the presence of diabetes.
